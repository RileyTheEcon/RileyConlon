										<p><strong>Welcome to my Research Portfolio!</strong></p>
										<h2>
											My name is Riley Conlon. I am a recent NYU grad and amateur Econometrics researcher. I hold an MA in Economics from NYU,
											a BA in Economics, a BS in Statistics and a BA in Pure Mathematics from Sonoma State University.
											My research interests are in Bayesian Regression Analysis, Machine Learning, and Computer Science applications to Economics. 
											I set up this website as a way to show off some of the research projects I have completed.
											I hope that you find this resporistory to be helpful.

										<h2>My Background</h2>
										<!--<h3>  </h3>-->
									</header>
									<a class="bordered-bio-image"><img src="images/bio_img.jpg" ALIGN="left" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										In 2017, I graduated from Sonoma State University with B.A.s in Economics and Pure Mathematics, and a B.S. in 
										Statistics. I started at SSU in 2012, the same year I graduated from Maria Carrillo High chool and completed the rank 
										of Eagle in the Boy Scouts of America. While I applied to SSU as an Economics major, as my fascination with Econometrics grew, 
										I added more degrees. What free time I had was devoted to the Economics and Mathematics clubs, Greek Life, tutoring 
										and working as a manager at a local movie theater.
									</p>
									<p>
										After graduating from SSU, I moved to New York City to start the Master's program in Economics at New York 
										University. While at NYU, I was introduced to Bayesian Econometrics and Machine Learning. The modeling techniques from 
										these areas became regular staples of many of my class projects. Even though I was enrolled in the Economics program, I 
										took as many classes in Math and Statistics from NYU's Courant School.
									</p>
									<p>
										In 2019, I graduated with an MA in Economics from NYU. From there, I began temporary work as a research assistant, while 
										working on my own research projects. It was during this time that I also began studying topics in Computer Science, 
										Mathematical Physics and Finance.
