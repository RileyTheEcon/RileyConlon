										<p><strong>Welcome to my Research Portfolio!</strong></p>
										<h2>
											Hi! My name is Riley Conlon, and I am a Statistician, Econometrician and Data Magician. <br>
											I am passionate about looking behind the curtain to uncover the structures driving complex 
											adaptive systems, from financial markets to human behavior. 
											My work aims to bridge traditional Econometrics, Bayesian Statistics, Causal Inference, and 
											Artificial Intelligence to better understand how information, incentives and uncertainty shape decisions. 
											With experience ranging from economic forecasting to Monte Carlo simulation modeling, 
											I strive to develop quantitative methods that are intuitive, transparent and yield robust insights into the economy.

									<p>
										Riley Conlon is a statistician and economist whose work explores how information, incentives, and uncertainty shape real-world decision-making. 
										His current research interests include identifying the drivers of inflation and disinflation, developing simulation-based tools for back-testing 
										trading algorithms, and investigating hierarchical models of asset pricing.
									</p>
									<p>
										Most recently, Riley served as an Economic Research Analyst at the Insurance Information Institute (Triple-I), where he and his team built models 
										for economic forecasting and presented results to C-suite executives across the non-health insurance industry. 
										Their work combined quantitative rigor with clear communication, translating complex data into insights on market conditions, risk trends, and policy impacts.
									</p>
									<p>
										Riley earned a Master of Science in Statistics from Duke University (2025) and a Master of Arts in Economics from New York University (2019). 
										He also completed three simultaneous undergraduate degrees from Sonoma State University: a B.A. in Economics, a B.S. in Statistics, and a B.A. in Pure Mathematics (2017).
									</p>
									<p>
										Originally from Santa Rosa, California, Riley graduated from Maria Carrillo High School (2012). 
										When not working on projects, he enjoys music, horror films, and games that emphasize strategy, management and efficiency.
