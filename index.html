										<p><strong>Welcome to my Research Portfolio!</strong></p>
										<h2>
											My name is Riley Conlon. I am a student and researcher of Econometrics. Specifically, my
											research interests are in Bayesian Machine Learning and replicabilitly in Machine Learning. 
											I set up this website to be a repository of my academic work, as well as my independent research.
											It is my goal in writing this to highlight the difficult steps in coding, model building, and 
											problem solving that are often excluded in publication.

										<h2>My Background</h2>
										<!--<h3>  </h3>-->
									</header>
									<a class="bordered-bio-image"><img src="images/bio_img.jpg" ALIGN="left" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										In 2017, I graduated from Sonoma State University with B.A.s in Economics and Pure Mathematics, and a B.S. in 
										Statistics. I started at SSU in 2012, the same year I graduated from Maria Carrillo High chool and completed the rank 
										of Eagle in the Boy Scouts of America. While I enrolled as an Economics major, as my fascination with Econometrics grew, 
										I added more degrees. What free time I had was devoted to the Economics and Mathematics clubs, Greek Life, tutoring 
										and working as a manager at a local movie theater.
									</p>
									<p>
										A few months after graduating from SSU, I moved to New York City to start the Master's program in Economics at New York 
										University. While at NYU, I was introduced to Bayesian Econometrics and Machine Learning. The modeling techniques from 
										these areas became regular staples of many of my class projects. In the months following my graduation from NYU in the 
										spring of 2019, I began studying and researching full-time in prepaprtion for starting in a PhD program.
									</p>
									<p>
										It is my goal to become a professor and researcher of Bayesian Machine Learning and Econometrics.
