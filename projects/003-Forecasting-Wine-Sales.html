											<i>My coauthor and I completed this paper for the Machine Learning course taught through the NYU Economics Master’s program. This was 
												done in our second semester in the program. Our prompt was to apply a variety of the ML techniques discussed in class to a problem 
												in Economics. </i>

											Forecasting Wine Sales under Optimal Advertising Strategy
											</a>
										</p>
										<p>
											<b>Summary:</b>
										</p>
										<p>
											For economists, wine is an especially interesting industry to analyze. For many consumers the price on the bottle is the only indicator 
											of the quality of the wine. In addition, in many states, it is illegal for wineries and distributors to explicitly collaborate with 
											stores to set prices on the shelf. It is under these conditions that marketing and price reductions are crucial.
										</p>
										<p>
											Our data contained sales information for two varietals from the same winery over a period of three years. The data also specified sales 
											by what promotional scheme was active at the time:
											<ul>
												<li> <b>Display</b> refers to any in-store display, usually this meant placement on an aisle end-cap or island.</li>
												<li> <b>Feature</b> refers to the wine being included in the store’s mail, newsletter, or newspaper advertising.</li>
												<li> <b>Display and Feature</b> refers to the use of Display and Feature simultaneously.</li>
												<li> <b>Temporary Price Reduction (TPR)</b> is the reduction of the wine’s price for a temporary period of time.</li>
												<li> <b>No-promo</b> was the shorthand in the data to refer to sales made in the absence of any promotion.</li>
											</ul>
										</p>
										<p>
											Our first goal was to utilize K-means clustering to explore whether there was evidence that the sale for the two varietals could be 
											considered distinct subgroups. Should K-means fail to find sufficient evidence of subgroups, we would conduct analysis on the dataset 
											as a whole; however, since our K-means algorithm returned strong evidence of two subgroups, we continued our analysis on the varietals 
											separately.
										</p>
										<p>
											From there we structured two models to include promotional and seasonal variables. Since the promotional strategies usually extended over 
											several weeks, we generated lagged terms equal to the typical length of the promotion, and included those variables in the model as well. 
											These models were fit using the Ridge and LASSO regression algorithms; however, since it produced the lower RMSE for both varietals, we 
											conducted the rest of our analysis with the LASSO models. The LASSO models had the added benefit of eliminating more unnecessary 
											variables.
											From there we back-fit the model to the data. We calculated the estimated sales, assuming optimal use of advertising as dictated by 
											the models. From our estimates we found that the winery could increase profits by several thousand dollars with more judicious use of 
											advertising.
										</p>
										<p>
											<b>Remarks:</b>
										</p>
										<p>
											This was an interesting project, and was our first hands-on experience with Machine Learning. Unfortunately, sales and marketing data 
											is not easily available to those outside the industry, and as a result we were unable to explore all of the questions we had about 
											the data. We would have like to explore how the effectiveness of advertising diminishes over time and what factors might influence 
											the diminishing returns. I have no doubt that the code and models from this project could be developed further with additional 
											industry data and be made to address these questions.
