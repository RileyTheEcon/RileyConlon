										<h2><strong><b>Identifying Unlikely Trends in the Performance of Baseball Teams</b></strong></h2>
									</header>
										<p>
											<i>(Originally posted February 17, 2020)</i>
										</p>
										<p>
											<b>Introduction:</b><br>
											On January 13, 2020, the MLB announced the suspensions of two Astros managers in connection with an 
											ongoing investigation into allegations of sign-stealing. The announcement stated that the Astros engaged 
											in a multiyear campaign to decrypt the hand signs used by pitchers and catchers to coordinate pitching 
											strategy<sup>1</sup>. As of writing, the full extent of this campaign is 
											uncomfirmed by officials; however, we know that knowing the next pitch would give the Astros a 
											considerable advantage in batting. Dodgers pitcher, Alex Wood tweeted in response: "I would rather face 
											a player that was taking steriods than face a player that knew every pitch that was coming."<sup>2</sup>
											It is from this scandal that we get our research questions for this project: Can we model the probability of a
											team's performance in a game given both teams' performance prior to that game, and then can we use those
											results to identify suspicious trends?
										</p>
										<p>
											Prior to starting on this research question, I was experimenting with the use of Bayesian Machine Learning 
											to predict the outcomes of baseball games. Specifically, I was comparing the efficacy of different BML methods. 
											As a part of that project, I developed a webscraping program for collecting the data for baseabll games from 
											online. Since I already had this application, I could not pass over the opportunity to tie this new 
											project into my ongoing work. With a few edits, I adapted my code to capture more information from 
											team-level batting statistics (total homeruns, total slugging percent, etc.). I reran my webscraper, 
											starting with Opening Day, 2000, and collected the data for 49,227 major league baseball games<sup>3</sup>.
											This will be our dataset for this project.
										</p>
										<p>
											In addition to introducing the premise of this project, this post will also explain how I built the code 
											for collecting the data. In the next post, I will explain my theoretical model, the 
											variables, and a discussion of some of my initial findings. After that, I will be positng the results of 
											my models with a discussion of my findings.
										</p>
										<p>
											<b>Data:</b><br>
											The source for our data is the Baseball Reference website. Its uniform layout makes it a reliable source 
											for accessing data with a webscraper. It is our goal to collect data for games starting in 2000. 
											By starting in 2000, we are also capturing data from the Steriod Era of baseball<sup>4</sup>. This data should provide a 
											reliable robustness test for our theoretical model. The Python libraries, Beautiful Soup (BS4) and URLlib, 
											provide the easiest tools to use for connecting to web servers, downloading a page's html, and then 
											formatting it. Specifically, Beautiful Soup is able to take the rough text of a webpage and parse it in 
											such a way that the tags used in html are seen as separate objects in Python. Since this project requires 
											downloading several pages, the first function we define bundles all those steps together.
										</p>
										<script src="https://gist.github.com/RileyTheEcon/f2cf0d6a9a8b97092a18d8ad990ebcf7.js"></script>
										<p>
											While we find it faster to parse text manually later in the project, the built-in BS4 html parser formats 
											the Baseball Reference's season schedule page fast and effectively. The page lists each game in its own 
											&lt;p&gt; tag, along with team names, final scores and links to relevant pages. Using BS4's <i>find_all</i>
											function with arguments, 'p' and 'game,' returns an array whose entries contain the information for each 
											game. From there, we use a <i>for</i> loop to read through each game. Thus, this array constitutes the 
											backbone of our webscraper.
										</p>
										<script src="https://gist.github.com/RileyTheEcon/995ddc874e525eaf5573b17f54cf23f9.js"></script>
										<p>
											Now that we have the text for each game organized, we can start extracting data. Unfortunately, this is 
											where the BS4  html format stops being helpful. We found it hard to navigate the pages and produce 
											consistent results using the methods attached to the BS4 objects. From this point, we opt to convert the 
											html object to a string, and start parsing text manually. Normally, this would imply excessive uses of 
											string subsetting; however, I developed a function to expedite this process.
										</p>
										<script src="https://gist.github.com/RileyTheEcon/f86be8aea41cafc8a4af5879c5ca3ecf.js"></script>
										<p>
											I developed <i>isolate_better</i> so that only one of the substrings passed to it needs to be unique in 
											the orinigal string. Attempting to subset a string using 
											<br>
											<i>string[string.find('substring A'):string.find('substring B')]</i>
											<br>
											might work well if <i>substring A</i> and <i>B</i> are unique in the string variable; however, if any 
											instances of <i>substring B</i> occur in the string before <i>substring A,</i> then the result will be an 
											empty string--Remember: we need to keep the code general enough to be applied to thousands of games. The 
											soultion we found was to take a slightly different approach with <i>isolate_better:</i> Given a unique 
											starting substring, it will only look for the end substring in the text following the starting substring; 
											alternatively, given a unique ending substring, it will only look for the start substring in the text 
											preceeding the ending substring. This proved to be extremely helpful working with the converted html, 
											where for example every entry in a table ends in <i>&lt;/td&gt;</i> but only one entry starts with 
											<i>&lt;data-stat="RBI"&gt;.</i>
										</p>
										<script src="https://gist.github.com/RileyTheEcon/7f410025a2bf34d165416d04ba469665.js"></script>
										<p>
											With this tool in hand, I was not only able to quickly pull the relevant data from the entry in the 
											season schedule, but also grab the URL from the link that connected to each game's specific page. Using 
											our dlURL function, we are able to follow the link and download the html from the game's page. Each game 
											in our season schedule list has its own page. It is these pages that provide the most data.
										</p>
										<p>
											At the start of our webscraper, we define three <i>pandas</i> dataframes. One dataframe for storing the 
											data we gather for each game, one dataframe for storing specific data about each team, and one dataframe 
											for storing data about each pitcher. The team dataframe holds the counts of each team's win/loss record 
											as well as the batting stats from their previous game. This allowed us to keep track of the team's 
											win/loss ratio for the season up to that game, as well as record the team's performance in the previous 
											game. After this data recorded in the game dataframe, the current game's data is saved to the team 
											dataframe to be used for their next game. Similar steps were taken to track and record the performance 
											of opening pitchers<sup>5</sup>.
										</p>
										<script src="https://gist.github.com/RileyTheEcon/64d978d4ada6a01d5961a947097cf084.js"></script>
										<script src="https://gist.github.com/RileyTheEcon/e0361eb0a086a0eade62fe29b5cf4943.js"></script>
										<p>
											The results of using the dataframes in this way is that our main dataset, the game dataframe, holds team 
											names, pitcher names, final score, a win/loss binary for the home team, both teams' win/loss ratio for 
											the season prior to the game, both teams' batting performance in their previous game, both starting 
											pitchers' win/loss ratio for the season prior to the game, and both pitchers' performance in the previous 
											season<sup>6</sup>. The other two dataframes, pitcher and team, allow us to collect the data in this 
											way. Since all three dataframes are exported as csv, this also allows us to add new games to the dataset 
											without needing to rerun the full webscraper.
										</p>
										<p>
											With these dataframes and the functions defined above, we are able to isolate specific stats on each page,
											find and access links to new pages, and capture from those pages as well. That is how our dataset for this 
											project is generated. In my next post, I will discuss how I chose our dependent variables, analyze the 
											initial trends in our data, and use LASSO to help determine which independent variables to consider going 
											forward.

											[5] Prior to my work using Bayesian Machine Learning with baseball data, I had briefly experimented with 
											building logit models to examine a similar dataset. My main finding from that practice was statistics 
											related to the starting pitchers had much stronger predictive power than any other statistic—except for 
											a few team averages. This finding informs my choice in focusing on statistics tied to starting pitchers 
											and the overall team.
											<br>
											[6] Statistics like WAR and its derivatives are usually reported at the season-by-season level. Thus 
											last season’s performance in these areas is included as a potential proxy for current season 
											performance.
