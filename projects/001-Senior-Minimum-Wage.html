												My coauthors and I completed this paper over the Fall 2016 semester for our ECON 417: Seminar in Econometrics course at Sonoma State
												University. We were given the prompt that the paper must use the estimators and models discussed in class, and that it must cover some
												aspect of minimum wage. Our inspirations for this paper came from two places: first, articles discussing generational differences 
												("Millennials are killing the ... industry") which were becoming popular at the time, and second, by the work of one of our professors
												at SSU.

											The Effect of Minimum Wage on Labor Force Participation among Young Individuals
											</a>
										</p>
										<p>
											<b>Summary:</b>
										</p>
										<p>
											In their paper analyzing the effect of the movie, <i>Sideways</i>, on the demand for Merlot, Steven Cuellar et al built a model for comparing
											the change in the trend in sales after the release of the movie compared to a similar varietal that acted as a control group. Specifically,
											they were able to compare whether the trend in Merlot sales decreased relative to the market following the release of the movie. If the change in
											the trend of Merlot sales was significantly less than the change in the competitor over the same time period, then there is empirical evidence
											of what the industry had been calling "The Sideways effect." What Cuellar discovered was that the decline in sales began long before the movie;
											therefore, there was no evidence for the Sideways effect.
										</p>

										<p>
											We sought to employ the same theoretical model to analyze how young people reacted to increases in the federal minimum wage over time. We 
											wanted to see if there was a significant difference in the responses to wage increases over time, and if so young people from which time 
											period responded the strongest and weakest. To that end, we collected yearly labor force participation rate data for people 15 to 24, and 
											people 25 to 54 as well as generated groups based on each increase of the federal minimum wage. With that data and in keeping with the 
											theoretical model, we composed a linear model that was the complete factorial design of Year, an Age Group indicator and an 
											After-Increase indicator.
										</p>
										<a class="feature-image"><img src="001-Senior-Minimum-Wage-img/model1.jpg" ALIGN="center" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											Our analysis of these effects came from comparing the &beta;<sub>7</sub> coefficients, since for each model it represents the change in the 
											participation rate attributable to just the behavior of young people. To complete the analysis, we would conduct a multiple-comparison 
											of each &beta;<sub>7</sub> coefficient to determine what difference, if any, there was. We expected to see a significant positive effect in 
											the first increase which decreased over each following increase until wage increases had an insignificant effect--this was informed by our 
											suspicion that the federal minimum wage had become a non-binding price floor for many people.
										</p>
										<p>
											In recognition that the degree by which the federal minimum wage increased was inconsistent, and that many states set their own minimum wage 
											above the federal, we specified a second model adapted from the first. In this second model, we replaced the before-and-after binary with 
											a new instrumental variable, the average effective minimum wage. We calculated this instrument as the inflation-adjusted average minimum 
											wage across each state. We tested both unweighted and weighted by state population versions of this instrument. To complete our analysis 
											of this model, we would compute an expected increase in participation given a fixed increase in wage over a period of time. We expected 
											our results to reinforce the results of our first model.
										</p>
										<a class="feature-image"><img src="001-Senior-Minimum-Wage-img/model2.jpg" ALIGN="center" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											The results of our first set of models showed a range of positive and negative, significant and non-significant changes in the trend in 
											labor force participation. From these results we might say that the 1977 increase, the first in the data, led tho the strongest decrease 
											in the labor force participation of young people and the 1989 increase led to the strongest increase; however, the presence of unaccounted 
											for confounding variables and low numbers of observations make such assessments dubious.
										</p>
										<a class="feature-image"><img src="001-Senior-Minimum-Wage-img/model1 results.jpg" ALIGN="center" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											Our second set of models provided a much more compelling set of results. Given a fixed increase in average effective minimum wage 
											(chosen to be within one standard deviation of the average annual change), we are able to analyze the expected change over time. 
											As we can see in the tables, as the model gets closer to present-day, the expected change goes from positive and significant to 
											insignificant, and then to negative and significant. This would imply a negative relationship between labor force participation and 
											wages for young people in recent years.
										</p>
										<a class="feature-image"><img src="001-Senior-Minimum-Wage-img/model-2-results.png" ALIGN="center" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											On their own, these results would be in conflict with the most basic principles of Supply and Demand. Binding and nonbinding price 
											floors provide an understanding for positive and significant, and insignificant results; however, they provide no framework for 
											interpreting negative and significant results. An investigation of opportunity costs provides one possible explanation. In her article 
											for NPR (
												<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/08/09/425363309/the-life-and-death-of-the-summer-job">"The Life and Death of the Summer Job"</a>
												), journalist Anya Kamenetz examines how higher admission standards for colleges have 
											translated to a higher opportunity cost for young people. It would appear that our model is possibly capturing the effect of young adults 
											focussing on course work and extracurriculars to the exclusion of low-paying, part-time work.
										</p>
										<p><b>Remarks:</b></p>
										<p>
											Despite its imperfections, I am very proud of this paper. My coauthors and I spent several hours every week debating models, reviewing 
											papers and transforming data in Excel by hand--trying to meet the end of the semester deadline. The following semester, we presented 
											the paper at the Sonoma State Research Symposium (2017), the Northern California Undergraduate Mathematical Conference (2017), and that 
											summer we presented it at the Western Economics Association International conference in San Diego (2017).
										</p>
										<p>
											In hindsight, there are a number of things I would do differently. I would have used monthly instead of yearly data. I think more 
											investigation of the correlations between some of the independent variables was warranted. I think we should have done a better job 
											addressing the fact that many of the people in the 25 to 54 age group also worked at or near minimum wage. This violates the assumption 
											in our models that the comparison group is unaffected by the change we are trying to analyze. To begin to address this, I would instead 
											compare the 15 to 24 group against the aggregated labor market participation rate. The models would then be acting to measure the degree 
											by which the trends in the younger group deviate from the average market-wide trends (similar to the use of S&P 500 in the CAPM from 
											Finance). Finally, I think further analysis of this topic should also take into account the opportunity cost of education. How such a 
											cost would be quantified for analysis, I am unsure.
